This absorbent wound dressing is lightweight yet effective, and\nideal for use underneath cotton bandages and first aid supports, helping to\nprotect a wound from the risk of infection while healing or awaiting further\nmedical treatment. Additionally, the sterile dressing can also be used in the\ntreatment and protection of minor wounds in and around the eye area.\n**Minimise wound trauma with a non-stick dressing** All AeroPadTM dressing\npads are designed with a special non-adherent film applied to each side to\nhelp protect healing wounds and minimise the risk of further damaging the area\nin or around the wound when changing the dressing. A bandage or some form of\nadhesive tape is required to effectively apply and hold the non-stick dressing\nto a healing wound. **SupaSorb technology for a premium absorbent dressing**\nAeroPadTM non-adherent dressing pads are fitted with a premium absorbent inner\nmaterial to aid in the treatment of weeping or bleeding wounds. Applying the\nabsorbent dressing enables a healing wound to stay dry, which is paramount for\ntreatment, infection mitigation and proper recovery.  _Remember: absorbent\ndressings require regular changing to help keep the wound clean._ **Each wound\npad dressing is individually packed and sterilised** The AeroPadTM non-\nadherent sterile dressing comes individually packaged to ensure that each\ndressing pad is kept clean and safe until needed. Applying a sterile wound\ndressing is key to keeping the wound clean and free from infection, allowing\nfor proper and effective healing. **A comprehensive range of sizes for all\nneeds** AeroPadTM non-adherent sterile wound dressings come in a variety of\nsizes to suit all wound and injury requirements, including:  _AeroPad TM Non-\nAdherent Dressing_\n\n  * 5x5cm, 7.5x5cm, 10×7.5cm, 10x10cm,10x20cm\n\n_AeroPad TM Non-Adherent Eyepad_\n\n  * 5×7.7cm\n\nIt’s recommended to keep a selection of AeroPadTM non-adherent dressings handy\nto be prepared to address any relevant accidents and injuries. Absorbent\ndressings are typically the most common dressings used in the treatment of\nminor surface and eye injuries. **Contraindications and Precautions** Non-\nadherent absorbent wound dressings should be changed daily, or more often,\naccording to the condition of the wound. A leaky wound poses a greater risk of\ninfection and requires regular cleaning to manage effective healing. Seek\nmedical advice immediately for all serious wounds and burns, and if redness or\ndiscomfort occurs, discontinue use and consult a physician or medical\nprofessional\n\n"

Absorbent\ndressings are typically the most common dressings used in the treatment of\nminor surface and eye injuries. **Contraindications and Precautions** Non-\nadherent absorbent wound dressings should be changed daily, or more often,\naccording to the condition of the wound. A leaky wound poses a greater risk of\ninfection and requires regular cleaning to manage effective healing. Seek\nmedical advice immediately for all serious wounds and burns, and if redness or\ndiscomfort occurs, discontinue use and consult a physician or medical\nprofessional"
